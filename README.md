# Xcode-Server-Bot-Integration-Scripts
These are scripts I run in the pre and post integration steps of Xcode Server bots. 

The great thing about using pre and post integration trigger in bots, as opposed to a Run Script Phase on the app target, is that you can have different behaviors for different bots. For example, if you want to integrate your build proccess with slack, and have a message posted to #general everytime you create a release build, you can go about this a few different ways. A more rigid and straight forward way would be to create a new Run Script Phase that checks to see if you are creating a release build, and POST to your custom slack webhook. But this has its problems, and isn't as flexible as we may want. A better way (assuming you are using Xcode bots with Xcode Server) would be adding a post-integration trigger to your build bot, and POSTing to your slack webhook there. This gives us much more flexibility to customiE our slack messages for each bot, and gives us better insight into the build process, like how many warnings our target has.
